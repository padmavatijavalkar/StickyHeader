        The Buddha, or Siddhartha Gautama, was born around 567 B.C.E., in a small
        kingdom just below the Himalayan foothills. His father was a chief of
        the Shakya clan. It is said that twelve years before his birth the
        brahmins prophesied that he would become either a universal monarch or a
        great sage. To prevent him from becoming an ascetic, his father kept him
        within the confines of the palace. Gautama grew up in princely luxury,
        shielded from the outside world, entertained by dancing girls,
        instructed by brahmins, and trained in archery, swordsmanship,
        wrestling, swimming, and running. When he came of age he married Gopa,
        who gave birth to a son. He had, as we might say today, everything. And
        yet, it was not enough. Something—something as persistent as his own
        shadow—drew him into the world beyond the castle walls. There, in the
        streets of Kapilavastu, he encountered three simple things: a sick man,
        an old man, and a corpse being carried to the burning grounds. Nothing
        in his life of ease had prepared him for this experience. When his
        charioteer told him that all beings are subject to sickness, old age,
        and death, he could not rest. As he returned to the palace, he passed a
        wandering ascetic walking peacefully along the road, wearing the robe
        and carrying the single bowl of a sadhu. He then resolved to leave the
        palace in search of the answer to the problem of suffering. After
        bidding his wife and child a silent farewell without waking them, he
        rode to the edge of the forest. There, he cut his long hair with his
        sword and exchanged his fine clothes for the simple robes of an ascetic.
        FINDING LIBERATION With these actions Siddhartha Gautama joined a whole
        class of men who had dropped out of Indian society to find liberation.
        There were a variety of methods and teachers, and Gautama investigated
        many—atheists, materialists, idealists, and dialecticians. The deep
        forest and the teeming marketplace were alive with the sounds of
        thousands of arguments and opinions, unlike in our time. Gautama finally
        settled down to work with two teachers. From Arada Kalama, who had three
        hundred disciples, he learned how to discipline his mind to enter the
        sphere of nothingness. But even though Arada Kalama asked him to remain
        and teach as an equal, he recognized that this was not liberation, and
        left. Next Siddhartha learned how to enter the concentration of mind
        which is neither consciousness nor unconsciousness from Udraka
        Ramaputra. But neither was this liberation and Siddhartha left his
        second teacher. For six years Siddhartha along with five companions
        practiced austerities and concentration. He drove himself mercilessly,
        eating only a single grain of rice a day, pitting mind against body. His
        ribs stuck through his wasted flesh and he seemed more dead than alive.
        THE MIDDLE PATH His five companions left him after he made the decision
        to take more substantial food and to abandon asceticism. Then,
        Siddhartha entered a village in search of food. There, a woman named
        Sujata offered him a dish of milk and a separate vessel of honey. His
        strength returned, Siddhartha washed himself in the Nairanjana River,
        and then set off to the Bodhi tree. He spread a mat of kusha grass
        underneath, crossed his legs and sat. He sat, having listened to all the
        teachers, studied all the sacred texts and tried all the methods. Now
        there was nothing to rely on, no one to turn to, nowhere to go. He sat
        solid and unmoving and determined as a mountain, until finally, after
        six days, his eye opened on the rising morning star, so it is said, and
        he realized that what he had been looking for had never been lost,
        neither to him nor to anyone else. Therefore there was nothing to
        attain, and no longer any struggle to attain it. “Wonder of wonders,” he
        is reported to have said, “this very enlightenment is the nature of all
        beings, and yet they are unhappy for lack of it.” So it was that
        Siddhartha Gautama woke up at the age of thirty-five, and became the
        Buddha, the Awakened One, known as Shakyamuni, the sage of the Shakyas.
        For seven weeks he enjoyed the freedom and tranquillity of liberation.
        At first he had no inclination to speak about his realization. He felt
        would be too difficult for most people to understand. But when,
        according to legend, Brahma, chief of the three thousand worlds,
        requested that the Awakened One teach, since there were those “whose
        eyes were only a little clouded over,” the Buddha agreed. THE FIRST
        NOBLE TRUTH Shakyamuni’s two former teachers, Udraka and Arada Kalama,
        had both died only a few days earlier, and so he sought the five
        ascetics who had left him. When they saw him approaching the Deer Park
        in Benares they decided to ignore him, since he had broken his vows. Yet
        they found something so radiant about his presence that they rose,
        prepared a seat, bathed his feet and listened as the Buddha turned the
        wheel of the dharma, the teachings, for the first time. Related: What
        are The Four Noble Truths? The First Noble Truth of the Buddha stated
        that all life, all existence, is characterized by duhkha. The Sanskrit
        word meaning suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness. Even moments of
        happiness have a way of turning into pain when we hold onto them, or,
        once they have passed into memory, they twist the present as the mind
        makes an inevitable, hopeless attempt to recreate the past. The teaching
        of the Buddha is based on direct insight into the nature of existence.
        Ir is a radical critique of wishful thinking and the myriad tactics of
        escapism—whether through political utopianism, psychological
        therapeutics, simple hedonism, or (and it is this which primarily
        distinguishes Buddhism from most of the world’s religions) the theistic
        salvation of mysticism. SUFFERING IS TRUE Duhkha is Noble, and it is
        true. It is a foundation, a stepping stone, to be comprehended fully,
        not to be escaped from or explained. The experience of duhkha, of the
        working of one’s mind, leads to the Second Noble Truth, the origin of
        suffering, traditionally described as craving, thirsting for pleasure,
        but also and more fundamentally a thirst for continued existence, as
        well as nonexistence. Examination of the nature of this thirst leads to
        the heart of the Second Noble Truth, the idea of the “self,” or “I,”
        with all its desires, hopes, and fears, and it is only when this self is
        comprehended and seen to be insubstantial that the Third Noble Truth,
        the cessation of suffering, is realized. THE FIRST SANGHA The five
        ascetics who listened to the Buddha ‘s first discourse in the Deer Park
        became the nucleus of a community, a sangha, of men (women were to enter
        later) who followed the way the Buddha had described in his Fourth Noble
        Truth, the Noble Eightfold Path. These bhikshus, or monks, lived simply,
        owning a bowl, a robe, a needle, a water strainer, and a razor, since
        they shaved their heads as a sign of having left home. They traveled
        around northeastern India, practicing meditation alone or in small
        groups, begging for their meals. Related: The Noble Eightfold Path The
        Buddha’s teaching, however, was not only for the monastic community.
        Shakyamuni had instructed them to bring it to all: “Go ye, O bhikshus,
        for the gain of the many, the welfare of the many, in compassion for the
        world, for the good, for the gain, for the welfare of gods and men.” For
        the next forty-nine years Shakyamuni walked through the villages and
        towns of India, speaking in the vernacular, using common figures of
        speech that everyone could understand. He taught a villager to practice
        mindfulness while drawing water from a well, and when a distraught
        mother asked him to heal the dead child she carried in her arms, he did
        not perform a miracle, but instead instructed her to bring him a mustard
        seed from a house where no one had ever died. She returned from her
        search without the seed, but with the knowledge that death is universal.
        DEATH AND IMPERMANENCE As the Buddha’s fame spread, kings and other
        wealthy patrons donated parks and gardens for retreats. The Buddha
        accepted these, but he continued to live as he had ever since his
        twenty-ninth year: as a wandering sadhu, begging his own meal, spending
        his days in meditation. Only now there was one difference. Almost every
        day, after his noon meal, the Buddha taught. None of these discourses,
        or the questions and answers that followed, were recorded during the
        Buddha’s lifetime. The Buddha died in the town of Kushinagara, at the
        age of eighty, having eaten a meal of pork or mushrooms. Some of the
        assembled monks were despondent, but the Buddha, lying on his side, with
        his head resting on his right hand, reminded them that everything is
        impermanent, and advised them to take refuge in themselves and the
        dharma—the teaching. He asked for questions a last time. There were
        none. Then he spoke his final words: “Now then, bhikshus, I address you:
        all compound things are subject to decay; strive diligently.” The first
        rainy season after the Buddha’s parinirvana, it is said that five
        hundred elders gathered at a mountain cave near Rajagriha, where they
        held the First Council. Ananda, who had been the Buddha’s attendant,
        repeated all the discourses, or sutras, he had heard, and Upali recited
        the two hundred fifty monastic rules, the Vinaya, while Mahakashyapa
        recited the Abhidharma, the compendium of Buddhist psychology and
        metaphysics. These three collections, which were written on palm leaves
        a few centuries later and known as the Tripitaka (literally “three
        baskets”), became the basis for all subsequent versions of the Buddhist
        canon.The Buddha, or Siddhartha Gautama, was born around 567 B.C.E., in a small

        shielded from the outside world, entertained by dancing girls,
        instructed by brahmins, and trained in archery, swordsmanship,
        wrestling, swimming, and running. When he came of age he married Gopa,
        who gave birth to a son. He had, as we might say today, everything. And
